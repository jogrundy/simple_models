Code to produce diagrams as shown in the paper


All the diagrams in the paper, as well as all the results tables can be generated using this code. 

The jupyter notebooks have the necessary code to run all the experiments, as well as the results from previously run experiments, used to generate images for the paper and for datasets not discussed in so much detail. 

This is a more user friendly supplimentary information.
